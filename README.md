## Project Description
I'm building a game of Hangman in Python. It lends itself well as a first project for a beginner, as there are many options for simplification (or making it more complex down the line). 

## Rules
The player has 10 turns to guess the letters of a secret word, which is chosen at random by the computer at the beginning of every game. The number of turns was chosen based on the amount of lines needed to draw the traditional hangman in the game. 
The player may choose to guess either one letter each turn or, if they’re feeling lucky, they can attempt to guess the whole word.<br/>
*However:*<br/>
If they guess the word wrong, it’s Game Over.<br/>
If the 10 turns run out before the player guesses the word, it’s Game Over.<br/> 

If the player guesses the word correctly or guesses all letters before the 10 turns are over, they win!


## Workflow
Step 1: 
Decided on the Hangman game out of a list of 8 possibilities. 

Step 2: 
Created a Trello board (pictured below).

Step 3:
Created a project repository (this one) to keep track of the project. 

Step 4: 
Researched the game. 

Step 4:
Chose which elements I would like to include in my version, such as: do I want to draw the hangman? (No). Do I want to give the player the option to guess the whole word if they so wish? (Yes). What are the consequences if they guess the wrong word? (Game Over). Do I want to add a turn counter? (Yes!)<br/>
All this depends on time constraint, so I will get back to this step later once I have the basics down. 

Step 5:
Pseudo-code

Step 6:
Find examples of game

Step 7:
Learn from example, tweak code to fit needs, research further as needed. 

## Organization
I planned my work using a Trello board

The Repository contains:
A Jupyter Notebook file of the Game program
README file
.gitignore
