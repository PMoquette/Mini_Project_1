## Project Description
I'm building a game of Hangman in Python. It lends itself well as a first project for a beginner, as there are many options for simplification (or making it more complex down the line). 

## Rules
The player has 10 turns to guess the letters of a secret word, which is chosen at random by the computer at the beginning of every game. The number of turns was chosen based on the amount of lines needed to draw the traditional hangman in the game. 

## Workflow
Step 1: 
Decided on the Hangman game out of a list of 8 possibilities. 

Step 2: 
Created a Trello board (pictured below).

Step 3:
Created a project repository (this one) to keep track of the project. 

Step 4: 
Researched the game. 

Step 4:
Choose which elements I want to include in my version, such as: do I want to draw the hangman? Do I want to give the player the option to guess the whole word if they so wish? All this depends on time constraint, so I will get back to this step later once I have the basics down. 

Step 5:
Pseudo-code

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
